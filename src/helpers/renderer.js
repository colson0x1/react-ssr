 * Resolution is to use the `react-router-config` lib for SSR!
 * But once we start using `react router config` library, routes must be
 * configured to be an array of objects where each object represents one route
 * instead of classic JSX configuration!
 * And we need to make sure that wherever we were using that routes component
 * in the past, we replace all those places with this new renderRoutes fn
 * from the `react router config` library.

// Routes here is an array of JavaScript objects. We're gonna pass that into
// the renderRoutes function. We can kind of imagine that renderRoutes right
// here takes an array of route objects, turns them into normal route components
// and then returns those.
// So at the end of the day, right now when we actually render our application,
// we still end up with some route components that we're very much used to
// working with in general, but they're being produced for us automatically
// by this renderRoutes function!
