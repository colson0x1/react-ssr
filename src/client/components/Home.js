/* @ Normal React Application
 * In a normal traditional React application, we would have a JavaScript file
 * that gets loaded into the browser and that then gets executed. The JS file
 * would render our JavaScript application, stick it into the DOM and then
 * attach any related event handlers that we set up inside of the code base.
 * So with the normal application, we ship down our entire JavaScript bundle
 * file to the browser and that renders the app and sets up event handlers
 * inside the browser.
 *
 * With this current setup, there's no JavaScript code being set down to the
 * users browser right now.
 * We make a request to the root route, the express server sends back the HTML
 * from that Home component and absolutely nothing else. There's no JS code
 * that is being loaded into the browser that sets up that event handler for us.
 * We could check that on the network log in response.
 * So in order to actually make sure that we get some JavaScript or have our
 * application work correctly, we need to make sure that we somehow ship down
 * all the JavaScript code related to our application after we ship down all
 * this HTML that gets some initial content on the screen.
 *
 * So right now in the Server Side world, we are taking care of step number one.
 * Step number one is getting HTML or getting content to show up on the screen.
 * Step number two is, however, is to make sure that we then load up our
 * React application and have the React application set up all the event handlers
 * and action creators and data loading requests and all that kind of stuff that
 * we normally want to have occur inside of our application.
