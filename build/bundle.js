/* @ src/index.js (Server Side Code) */

// React SSR
/* @ Server Side Rendering (SSR)
 * - Generates HTML on the server
 * @ Server Side Templating (EJS)
 * - Generates HTML on the server
 *
 * SSR refers to our ability to somehow produce HTML on our server side and
 * ship it down to the user's browser.
 * The is kind of misleading terminology because technically we're doing
 * server side rendering even without React, or we can do server side rendering
 * without React. We could use HTML templates on the server like EJS, Handlebars
 * or Pug and that's really still server side rendering! So we could also refer
 * to that as server side templating.
 *
 * Some people decided that the term Server Side Rendering wasn't specific enough,
 * so they came up with two other terms.
 * @ Universal JavaScript
 * - The same code runs on the server and the browser
 * @ Isomorphic JavaScript
 * - The same code runs on the server and the browser
 *
 * So those two terms were Universal JavaScript and Isomorphic JavaScript.
 * Both these terms essentially mean that some amount of code that we're writing
 * on the server might also be executed on the browser, and the opposite is
 * true as well. So code that is intended for the browser might be executed
 * on the server.
 * There is one specific thing inside of our app that kind of flies right in the
 * face of this whole idea of Universal JavaScript or Isomorphic Javascript
 * and that is the two different module systems. So inside of index.js, we're
 * making use of CommonJS module system that is characterized by require
 * statements. But inside of our Home Component, we're using ES2015 Modules,
 * which is a distinctly different module system.
 * Part of working with Isomorphic or Universal JavaScript means that, we should
 * be able to use the exact same coding style on both our client side and
 * server side!
 * Normally we need to use CommonJS for NODE because no ES2015 Module was
 * supported for NODE until few years ago.
 * However, running Webpack and Babel over our entire codebase which includes
 * the NODEjs inside of this index.js file could make ES2015 Module system
 * work in NODEjs even before it was officially supported.
 * So because our server files are being handled by Webpack, we can make use of
 * ES2015 Modules on our Server Side code as well.
 * And we want to do that specifically to kind of lessen the distinction between
 * our server side code and and client side code.
 * In other words, as Engineers, as we're working on these projects, we don't
 * want to have to do a big context shift as we start working on our React
 * code versus Express code. We want to be able to write the exact same
 * dialect of JavaScript on both sides.
 *
 * @ Isomorphic React
 * - The same code runs on the server and the browser
 **/

// CommonJS module syntax or the `require` syntax

/* @ ReactDOM */
// ReactDOM library has `render` and also the `renderToString` fn
// `render` fn creates instances of a bunch of components and mounts them to a
// DOM node
// `renderToString` renders a bunch of components one time and produces a string
// out of all the resulting HTML. So rather than mounting to some DOM node,
// instead renders all those components to exactly one time, converts the
// output of them to raw HTML and returns it as a string.

/* @ Make NODE to recognize the JSX! */
// We're going to take the index.js and the Home.jss and feed those into
// Webpack and Babel. Babel will be responsible for turning all that JSX into
// normal ES5 code. We eventually end up with bundle.js file and we use NODE
// to run that file
// So by using the Webpack approach for our Server Side code, all we're really
// doing is saying, hey NODE: you don't have to handle any of the require
// statements before you run any code at all, Webpack will go through and
// build a bundle with all of our different modules included into it!

// When we run Webpack on the server, it spits out a compiled or transpiled
// JavaScript file that contains not only all of our server code but all of
// the React components inside of our application as well.

// Probelm I: JSX on the server
// Solution: Webpack and Babel
// With traditional React Apps, we normally have a bunch of JavaScript files
// to run all of our server side code and then a bunch of JavaScript files for
// our client side project.
// With Server Side Rendering (SSR), however, that all gets combined into one
// single application that contains both our Client and our Sever logic.
// So that is how we are able to render the client application on the server.

// Probelm II: Need to turn components into HTML
// Normally we use ReactDOM library's render function to take a component and
// mount it into a specifice DOM node on the server.
// On the server, we use the renderToString function to take a bunch of
// components and turn them into raw HTML.
// This renders all of our React Components exactly one time, builds an HTML
// strucuture out of them and then sends the result down to our browser.

/* @ Two Bundle by Webpack
 * We've now two separate bundles. One for server and one for client.
 * However, the client bundle is still not actually getting downloaded by
 * the browser when someone accesses our root ('/') route.
 * To make sure that our browser attempts to actually pick up that newly
 * created client side bundle. We'll first open all the folders on the public
 * directory to the outside world by telling Express to treat this public
 * directory as a freely available public directory.
 * */

// Webpack allows us to use ES2015 modules on our front end code.
// So because our server files are being handled by Webpack, we can now make
// use of ES2015 modules on our server side code as well.
// We want to do that to use the exact same coding style on both the React
// specific code and on our Server Side code (Express) as well

// @ Ignore files with Webpack
// When Webpack sees import statement example files or libraries like React,
// ReactDOM.. it  will go and grab all of the code that represents that module
// and pull that entire library into the output bundle.
// This is the behavior we want Webpack to work with browser applications but
// not with sever. So for browser based applications, we definitely want
// Webpack to behave in that fashion. We want Webpack to copy that entire library
// into the Bundle.js file because one of the big goals of Webpack on the
// browser is to condense down all of our assets into one single file.
//
// But on the server, which is where we are running this file here, that's a
// little bit of a different story.
// So here's what's happening on the Bundle. So on Server Side Webpack process
// that we're running.
// Our server bundle is importing Express, React and ReactDOM which means that
// when Webpack runs for our server process, it copies the source code, the
// entire source code of Express, React and ReactDOM into our output bundle.js
// file. This is not actually required because with NODE, unlike the browser,
// with NODE, we can require NODE modules at runtime when our server first
// starts up!!
//
// This isn't a big deal like it's not the worst thing in the world to be requiring
// these modules into the final bundle.js file because we are not shipping this
// server side bundle anywhere like we are with the browser. So we're not super
// concerned with the size of the server bundle at all. So The size of that
// file, not a big deal!
//
// BUT if we do reduce the number of libraries that needs to be placed into
// that bundle file on the Server Side, we'll end up with a faster webpack
// process, particularly during the initial startup Webpack run.
// So not a big deal
// BUT if our application starts to grow to be really large in size on the server,
// we can definately shave off a couple of seconds here from the initial Webpack
// startup time!!
// It's not the worst thing in the world.
// Hence, its good to keep Webpack from importing our libraries into our
// server bundle.

/* @ Render Helper
 * This refactor is going to seem small right now. But as soon as we start to
 * add in technologies like React Router, Redux and some other stuff, this
 * refactor is really going to pay off.
 * Inside of our index.js file, we appear to be locating every last scrap of
 * server side rendering logic inside this file right now. That's definitely
 * okay for now, but eventually we expect this route handler right here to
 * start to dramatically grow in size.
 * So to keep this file from getting too large, we should split out the logic
 * that renders our React app off to a separate file.
 * Right now, it's not going to be an immediate big difference. But as time
 * goes on, this separation of logic is going to really help to add clarity to
 * our server process.
 *
 * This definitely helps to separate out this Express related logic right here
 * from the actual server side rendering and React logic.

// working with in general, but they're being produced for us automatically

/* @ Dump state to Templates */
// By the time the store gets shoved into this function right here, it has all
// of this initial state inside of it. So we've already called all of those
// load data functions. We've already processed all the actions resulting
// from that, and we've taken all that state and put it into the store.
// So we can think of this `store` right here i.e (req, store), as kind of
// like an encyclopedia full of information.
//
// So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna add a second script tag to our HTML
// document right here. This is going to be a script tag that is not going to
// attempt to load up a JavaScript file from the server like `src='bundle.js'`.
// Instead, it's going to put down some literal JavaScript code directly into
// our template where we're going to write some raw JavaScript where we get
// all the state out of our store and then turn that into JSON data so that it
// can be safely printed our there or essentially injected into the string.
// If we attempt to just call ${store.getState()} and then put that into the
// string,, we would end up with this classic looking JavaScript error:
// ie. [Object object]
// So we have to turn this into JSON first before we put it into the string
// with JSON.stringify()
// i.e. window.INITIAL_STATE = ${JSON.stringify(store.getState())}
// That's pretty much it!
//
// So now all we have to do on the Client Side is locate our Client Side,
// createStore function and pass in this window.INITIAL_STATE as the initial
// state object, or in other words, the second argument to the createStore()
// function!

/* @ Mitigate XSS Attacks */
// But doing this: window.INITIAL_STATE = ${JSON.stringify(store.getState())}
// directly into our template is actually vulnerable to a little security flaw.
/* https://react-ssr-api.herokuapp.com/users/xss */
// By default, React protects against XSS attacks, but only on content that it,
// specifically React renders!
// So whenever we take our state out of our Redux store and try to dump it
// directly into our HTML template, we need to be very aware of attacks like
// this because they are just trivially easy for hackers to execute.
//
//
// Resolution to XSS:
// Here, we're currently dumping all of our state out into the HTML template.
// i.e. window.INITIAL_STATE = ${JSON.stringify(store.getState())}
// Now what we really have to do is kind of scrub the state right here.
// We've to go through all the data that is begin, that is contained within
// our Redux store and take care of any malicious code that is inside of there.
// So there's really not a lot that we can do against, say, trying to keep our
// API from getting bad data inside of it.
// We should always just assume that somehow bad data might end up inside of
// our application. So rather than trying to war against the API side, we're
// going to make sure that whatever data we dump into our template i.e store.getState(),
// is not going to accidentally be executed.
// SO to take care of this, we're going to import a library called
// JavaScript Serialize.
// Serialize right here is a function that takes a string and will essentially
// escape any charactes in there that are involved with setting up script tags,
// for example, the actual less than sign and greter than sign of the script tag
// like that.
// We replace JSON.stringify() with serialize()
// i.e ${serialize(store.getState())}
// THat will process it and we no longer have something like alert like that.
// <script> tag will no longer be executed by the browser.
// So essentially what this Serialize tool does is it takes any special characters
// like those < or > signs and it replaces them with their Unicode equivalents.
// So we convert all those bad tokens into the Unicode equivalents so that the
// browser inside the script tag will not attempt to execute those code.
// But when the browser attempts to actually render that token right there out
// on the page, it will convert it back to ASCII or something like visually
// equivalent for whatever the unicode character is!

/* @ Authentication */
/* @ Current authentication situation! */
// Authentication process is a contract between the API server and the browser
// that is held via cookies, jwt. Cookies in our case!
// All cookies in the browser corresponds to the server at the domain, subdomain
// and port that issued them.
// In another words, when we get a cookie set from our API at say `api.app.com`,
// when we make a request over to `www.app.com`, the cookie that had been
// assigned from `api.app.com` is not sent along to `www.app.com`.
// So as soon as we start accessing different domains, subdomains or ports,
// those cookies are not automatically included in the request.
// So in other words, if we make a request off to the API server and we get
// our identifying token, we get our cookie,
// a follow up request made to render server over here is not going to include
// the cookies. So this render server cannot somehow take the cookie from
// that request and make an authenticated request ocer to the API.
//
// So, We can definitely get a cookie assigned to the users browser from the API
// by going through the usual authentication flow. But we don't have a great way
// of somehow sharing that cookie with the render server.
// Now this is a big issues because at some point in time we're going to want the
// render server to be able to make an authenticated request over to the API.
//
// @ Solution
// @ Authentication via Proxy
// So to solve this, we're going to use a little bit of trickery.
// We're going to set up a proxy directly on our render server. We are going
// to make sure that whenever a user attempts to authenticate with our app,
// rather than sending the user's browser directly over to the API, we will
// instead send the user to the proxy running on our render server.
// The proxy will then forward that request for authentication onto the API.
// After a cookie is issued by the API, the proxy will then communicate that
// cookie back to the browser. So as far as the browser is concerned, the API
// server does not exist. The browser is going to think that it's just communicating
// with our render server. But unbeknownst to the browser, the browser has a
// proxy that is invisibly sending the requests out to the API server. The result
// is that the browser is going to think that this authentication cookie that it
// gets back is being issued by the render server, not by the API. So any follow
// up requests beging made to the render server will include that orignal
// authentication cookie that had been issued by the API.
// Then the render server will make all the needed requests to the API and
// manually attach the cookie onto that request to prove that the user is
// authenticated.
//
// Phase I: Initial page load phase!
// The thing to keep in mind is that during the initial page load period, the
// server is going to make attempt to some request to our API on behalf of the
// browser. So during the initial page load phase, the server needs to have
// access to some cookie that proves that the original user from the browser
// is logged in, so the proxy will not be active during this phase. There is
// nothing to proxy. The server is going to make requests on behalf of the browser,
// so we're going to have to somehow manually attach the cookie that got sent
// from the original page load request (i.e from browser) to this follow up
// request or this or this request over to the API over API Server so we can
// kind of imagine that this cookie (browser) gets attached right to this
// request over to the API.
//
// Phase II: Follow up request phase
// So after that initial page load, any follow up request are going to be issued
// directly from the browser. So this would be like some follow up AJAX request
// that is being ussued by our React application. So this is where the proxy is
// going to start to come into play. During this phase, the server will no longer
// touch or modify incoming requests. It will simply pass requests on to the API
// through the use of this proxy.
// Now these two different phases are going to result in some pretty interesting
// code. So we have to write code to make sure that during the initial page load
// request phase, we attempt to make request to the API directly because they are
// coming from the server. But then after that we're going to make sure that
// all the requests that are being made from our application are going to be
// passing through our server, through the proxy onto the API Server.

// We're not importing Provider here like on client.js and that's because the
// soul purpose of this file right now is to create the Redux store whereas
// inside the client.js file, we want it to both create the Redux store and
// then immediately use it inside the React application.

// The Redux store on this Server is going to behave slightly different than
// it does on the client.
// One of the big drivers behind this is the fact that we have this big challenge
// here where we need to do some detection of when we finish all of our initial
// data loading (i.e detect when all initial data load action creators are completed
// on server) before we attempt to actually render our application.
// And so a lot of the running theme around creating this Redux Store on the
// Server is going to be all about creating the store and working with it in some
// fashion before we ever attempt to render our application inside the renderer.
// And so that's why we are not tying the store creation on the server very
// closely to that Provider tag, because as soon as we make that Provider tag,
// it really indicates that we are trying to or attempting to render our
// application.
// So in other words, we're just creating the store inside of here and that's it!

/* @ Client State Rehydration
 * The current state of client side React App is, clearing out the page
 * temporarily because none of our server side state from the Redux store is
 * being communicated down to the browser.
 * That is why we see, user's list after 2 seconds on the browser!
 *
 * We want to make sure that when we send down our application from the server
 * to the browser, when the React application rehydrates on the client side or
 * on the browser side, it doesn't think oh hey there's some content that
 * shouldn't be here, we want to somehow preserve the state that we've
 * prefetched from the server and somehow communicate the state down to
 * the browser.
 *
 * Solution:
 * We're going to add two additional steps into our Server Side Rendering flow.
 * As we render the HTML document on our server, we're going to simultaneously
 * take all of our state in our Redux store. So all the state that we've shoved
 * in there from all those load data functions and we're going to take that state
 * and dump it as JSON data into our HTML template.
 * So the HTML document will not only contain all of our pages HTML, but it will
 * also contain the raw data that was used to render it from our Redux Store.
 * Then we send the HTML document down to the browser. We send the client
 * bundle.js file, React starts up, Redux starts up. And then here's the important
 * part, the client side store, when we initialize it, we're going to take all
 * that JSON data that we dumped into our HTML template and we're going to pass
 * it into the client side, create store function as the second argument, So
 * when our Redux app boots up on the client side, it'll have an initial state
 * state as that is the exact same as what was used to render the page on the
 * sever.
 * And so in theory, once the React app renders that first time on the browser,
 * it should be using the exact same data to render the application as was used
 * on the server. And so when it renders on the browser, the React app will
 * render, it will realize, okay, I'm going to render the UsersList Component,
 * it's going to pull the list of users out of the store and that list of users
 * will result in this list of <li>'s right there with data.
 * And so we should no longer see this warning message down there on the browser:
 * @ Warning: Did not expect server HTML to contain a <li> in <ul>.
 * So we should be no longer seeing that warning message because that initial
 * hydration step on the browser will be using the exact same data or the exact
 * same list of users. And so the React app will think that, yep, there definitely
 * should be a list of <li>'s inside this URL i.e localhost:3000/users
 *
 * So that's pretty much the solution!!
 * We're going to take all of our state ouf of the Redux Store, dump it into
 * the HTML template, and then use that to initialize our store on the client
 * side!!!

/* @ Normal React Application
 * In a normal traditional React application, we would have a JavaScript file
 * that gets loaded into the browser and that then gets executed. The JS file
 * would render our JavaScript application, stick it into the DOM and then
 * attach any related event handlers that we set up inside of the code base.
 * So with the normal application, we ship down our entire JavaScript bundle
 * file to the browser and that renders the app and sets up event handlers
 * inside the browser.
 *
 * With this current setup, there's no JavaScript code being set down to the
 * users browser right now.
 * We make a request to the root route, the express server sends back the HTML
 * from that Home component and absolutely nothing else. There's no JS code
 * that is being loaded into the browser that sets up that event handler for us.
 * We could check that on the network log in response.
 * So in order to actually make sure that we get some JavaScript or have our
 * application work correctly, we need to make sure that we somehow ship down
 * all the JavaScript code related to our application after we ship down all
 * this HTML that gets some initial content on the screen.
 *
 * So right now in the Server Side world, we are taking care of step number one.
 * Step number one is getting HTML or getting content to show up on the screen.
 * Step number two is, however, is to make sure that we then load up our
 * React application and have the React application set up all the event handlers
 * and action creators and data loading requests and all that kind of stuff that
 * we normally want to have occur inside of our application.
 *
 * Solution to that Pain Point:
 * Create two JavaScript bundles using Webpack. One bundle is going to contain
 * all of our server side and client side code i.e our current setup
 * webpack.server.js AND now we create another bundle for React app which will
 * be shipped down to the users browser.
 * The reason we want to have two bundles is our Server Side bundle and the
 * Server Side code inside of it might contain sensitive information or sensitive
 * code. For example, it might contain some secret API keys or special logic
 * that could somehow be exploited. So there's going to be some amount of code on
 * our server that we never want to ship down to the browser.
 * So to implement this, we are going to set up a second Webpack pipeline that's
 * going to run right along side our current one.
